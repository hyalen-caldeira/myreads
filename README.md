In the MyReads project, I've created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

In this application, the main page should displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read.

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library. To keep the interface consistent, you may consider re-using some of the code you used to display the books on the main page.

This project was started using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

 Instructions for the methods are below.

 |-- index.css - Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
|-- .gitignore
|-- CONTRIBUTING.MD - Information about contributing to this repo.
TL;DR - Fork and clone your own version of this to use it.
|-- README.MD - This README file.
|-- SEARCH_TERMS.md - The whitelisted short collection of available search terms
for you to use with your app.
|-- package.json - npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

Te application access the backend server develop by Udacity. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

### `getAll()`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update(book, shelf)`
* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search(query, maxResults)`
* query: `<String>`
* maxResults: `<Integer>` Due to the nature of the backend server, search results are capped at 20, even if this is set higher.
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
